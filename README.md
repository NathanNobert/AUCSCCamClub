*Camrose Boys & Girls Club App*

This project was done for AUCSC320 - Software Engineering II class over the period of January 4, 2018 to January 19, 2018.
The goal for this app is to manage information about donors, members, and volunteers for the club and take in information through an appealing and simple to use interface and then represent the data concisely and also in a visually appealing way.  

The eventual goal is to have this app integrate a database to better store the information collected throughout each form.
